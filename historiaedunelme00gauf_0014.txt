viii PREFACE.

by Wharton in his Anylz'a Sacra, in the year 1691,
with an intimation, however, in his Preface,* thache had
not strictly followed his Manuscript‚ that he had rejected
useless matter, and had occasionally condensed portions
of his Author, for the sake of brevity3 but how far this
was done with the judgment of which he speaks, and
how far such portions of each historian as he actually
published were edited with fidelity, will appear-in the se-
quel.†

In the year 17r5‚ Bishop Burnet, in the Introduction
to the third part of his History of the Reformation,‡
directed the attention of his readers to the general in-
accuracy of the Anglia Sacra. ‘⁶ I have,” says he, “a

of the See. On this subject see the xmxth and Lth Chapters of his History‚
(p. 120, Sco), in which he speaks of himself and his electiori and persecu-
tions with great modesty and forbearance. An engraving of the Episcopal
Scal‚ which it was his intention to have used, may be found in SURTEEs.
Seals, pl. III. No. L For further particular-s of his history see Surrmm,
Vol. Ι. p. xlv„ and Hmcnmsoiv, Vol. I. p. 284.

Of CHAMBRE nothing is known. Wharton’s reason for ascribing the third
History in our series to a person of this name, rests upon the circumstance,
that in the Cottonian MS. the Narrative of Graystanes terminates with the
Lit'e of Bishop Bury, which is stated in a note to be extracted from the
Dru-liam IIistoty of W imam de Chambre, and as this extract corresponds
word for word with the commoncement of the Bodleian MS„ of which he
and we make use, he not unreasonahly supposes Chfflnbre to be the author
of the whole. This History is moro conciso than the preceding two, and,
in many instances, is not much more than nn absh-aet of names and dates.
Bes-ides, its author, upon more than one occasion, in characterising persons
of whom he is speaking, borrows words and phrases from Coldingham. It
is probable that more than one person were concerncd in this compilation.

'l' Wharton> L, p. 668, applies to poor Funereal W‘eever the harsh cha-
racter of being ‘² morialium onmium infelicissimus‚'' for having· given
a few wrong dates in his “Monunmnrsss’ xthat a pity that wc have no
