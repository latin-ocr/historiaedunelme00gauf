work lying on my table, which shows how little regard is
due to his [Wharton's] Collections. It was sent me by
a worthy person in one of the Universities, and is a col-
lating of ten pages of his Anglia Sacra, with the manu-
script that he vouches: it swells, indeed, to a book.
Wharton omits the most material passage of an instru-
ment that blemished one of his heroes. In some places
there are errors in every line ς and there are three capital
errors in one line, and about fifty in that small com-

The publication of the three Durham Historians had
been determined upon by the Surtees Society before its
notice was attracted by the above censure, which in-

held by the Historian whose words we have quoted, and

justificatior] should be necessary.

The Editor of the present volume having had, some
time ago, an occasion to consult that portion of the Ana

and not unfrequently by an δια, which, as he suspected,
was the διο. of the editor and not of the author. He
met, besides, in almost every page, with misread or mis-
printed local names, and, occasionally, with a date mani-

festly erroneous.
These suspicions and inferences led him, soon after-

to the publication of Manuscripts only.
