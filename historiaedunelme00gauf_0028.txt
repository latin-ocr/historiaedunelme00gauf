xxii PREFACE.

See, and we are sorry to say that Lee’s Book, here spoken
of, has also disappeared.

The Episcopal Registers‚ we regret to state, are al-

is no case of the noun which it is not compelled to bear,
when in reality there never was any such word. “ Alex-
ander Archiepiscopus Eborum”—“ duos cuneos pro
cambio suo Eborum.’' These are extracts from a single
record in the Foedera. In the former for Eborum read
Eboracensz'S, and in the latter for Eborum read Eboraci.
