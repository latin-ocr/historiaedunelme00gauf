rREFACE. xi

which he used is equally pure, and that, in almost every
instance, he is to blame for the deficiencies and impuri-
ties of his publication.

The imperfections of Wharton's edition may be classed
under the following heads :—

lst. His numerous misreadings and mispunctuations
of the MS. from which he printed. Qndly. His arbitrary
emendations of his faulty transcript. Srdly. His con-
densation into a few words of whole passages or para-
graphs. And, 4thly. His omission of nearly a full half
of the narrative of Coldingham and GraystaneS‚ indicat-
ing his omissions with an occasional ῥῶ, but more fre-
quently giving no intimation whatever of the liberty he
was taking with his author or his readeiz*

In proof of the first charge, the following instances are
selected from many hundreds which might have been
adduced :—

Wharton‚ p. 718. Cap. 1, “ Monachis aut Provinci-
alibus molestiam nullam retribuit3 nec ecclesiae possessio-
nes aut ornamenta contulit.” For retribuit the MS.
reads intulit, and for contulit, abstulit, (p. 4³²).

Wharton‚ p. 719. l. 24, “ Quid sit moribus presulis
congruum.'' The MS. for presulis conyruum, reads
inservire plurimorum, (p. 4).

Wharton‚ p. 721. l. 16, “ offam aliquam.” MS.
officia aliqua, (p. 7).

'³³‘ It will be seen above, that Wharton admits in his Preface, in general
terms, his having occasionally condensecl or omitted certain passages in his
manuscript 3 but to what extent and with what judgmcnt will be seen at
large in our pages.

† These latter references are to the pages in our volume, in which the
passages or words we refer to occur.
