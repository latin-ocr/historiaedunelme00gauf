XX PREFACE.

public Records of the Kingdom. Three of these we

have transferred to our pagos (AppendiX, XXXIV. xxxv.
and XLI). The rest are well known, and most of them

may be found in one or other of the two Histories of the
County.

A question may be asked, why, amidst the treasures
printed in the Appendix from the Records of the Dean
and Chapter, no Documents have been brought to light
from the Archives of the See, in illustration of the His-
tory of its Bishops. The truth must be told. The See
of Durham does not possess one original Record. All
its Saxon and Norman Grants are lost, and we have no
clue to the period or cause of their abstraction or destruc-
tion. As no original Records are transcribed in Cosin's
Collection above noticed‚ it may be inferred that they
had disappeared before the year 1663, and if so, pro-
bably during the usurpation‚ when the Castle of Dur-
ham became the property of a layman, who might have
1 110 respect for documents referring to estates in which
he had no concern, and which had themselves been dis-
persed into various hands. It seems quite clear that if
Cosin had been in possession of the original grants of
the See, he would not have contented himself with re-
gistering a few transcrith obtained from other sourceS,
many os them probably at a considerable expense. And
yet the following extract from a manuscript ‘⁶ State of
Records of ye County Palatine of Durham,” compiled
apparently in the beginning of the last century, brings
the existence of these Records down to the year 1671,
and even to a later period, and lays the blame of their
destruction upon Bishop Cosin's Executors,
